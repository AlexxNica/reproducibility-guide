The current ecosystem of tools for developing reproducible research documents with R is small, but growing.  We have included a collection of annotated links below that provide additional information about the tools that are included in a number of the [workflows detailed on this site](http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/2014/03/30/Useful-Workflows.html).

## Authoring

- [Scholarly Markdown Wiki](https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/Tools-to-support-your-markdown-authoring): Great starting point from Scholarly Markdown Project.  The wiki provides a list applications that provide support for authoring in Markdown.  In addition to the listing of tools, there are many other great resources available here, including a basic tutorial on markdown, how to include common manuscript elements (citations, figures, tables, etc.), and some advanced formatting topics.
- [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/): A powerful IDE for R.  Supports syntax highlighting of Markdown plus preview views of output documents (html in current release, additional formats in preview release).   
- Text Editor: Not trying to enter the text editor battle du jour, so no names will be mentioned!  Use what you like!
