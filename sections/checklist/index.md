Here is a list of questions to ask yourself while performing your research.  

## Documentation

- Is it clear where to begin? (e.g., can someone picking a project up see where to start running it)
- can you determine which file(s) was/were used as input in a process that produced a derived file?
- who do I cite? (code, data, etc.)
- Is there documentation about every result?
- have you noted the exact version of every external application used in the process?
- For analyses that include randomness, have you noted the underlying random seed(s)?
- Have you specified the license under which you're distributing your content, data, and code?
- Have you noted the license(s) for others peoples' content, data, and code used in your analysis?

## Organization

- which is the most recent data file/code?
- which folders can I safely delete?
- do you keep older files/code or delete them?
- can you find a file for a particular replicate of your research project?
- have you stored the raw data behind each plot?
- is your analysis output done hierarchically? (allowing others to find more detailed output underneath a summary)
- do you run backups on all files associated with your analysis?
- how many times has a particular file been generated in the past?
- why was the same file generated multiple times?
- where did a file that I didn't generate come from?

## Automation

- Are there lots of manual data manipulation steps are there?
- Are all custom scripts under version control?
- Is your writing (content) under version control?

## Publication

- Have you archived the exact version of every external application used in your process(es)? [may be redundant, see similar question in Documentation section of checklist above)
- Did you include a reproducibility statement or declaration at the end of your paper(s)?
- Are textual statements connected/linked to the supporting results or data?
- Did you archived preprints of resulting papers in a public repository?
- Did you release the underlying code at the time of publishing a paper?
- Are you providing public access to your scripts, runs, and results?
