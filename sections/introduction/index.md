# Introduction 

Reproducibility is an increasingly important topic in discussions of doing good science. As science becomes more complex, particularly due to the increased role of computational methods, it is less likely that the descriptions contained in scholarly publications are sufficient for others to obtain substantially similar results on their own or extend the published method to new data or new applications. Tackling the challenges of doing reproducible research has resulted in many scholarly publications, as well as instructive blog posts, videos and other resources, which we list [here](http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/sections/references/). In this short introduction, we briefly summarise some of the principles, definitions and complexities of reproducible research that have emerged in the literature. We also outline some basic and widely applicable steps for promoting reproducibility. While our specific tool and workflow suggestions focus on the computational environment of the R programming language, the principles and definitions sketched out here are applicable to researchers working in any environment. You are welcome to contribute to this guide (fix typos, add to the [reference list](https://github.com/ropensci/reproducibility-guide/blob/gh-pages/sections/references/index.md), etc.) by submitting a pull request to its [github repository](https://github.com/ropensci/reproducibility-guide). 

# Principles of Reproducible Research

The motivating principle for reproducible research is that the traditional unit of scholarly communication - a published article - is only the tip of the iceberg of the research process. Jon Claerbout, one of the pioneers of reproducible research, described the article as merely an advertisement for research (Claerbout and Karrenbach 1992): 

> An article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result. 

In most cases, when we have only an article, we are unable to engage with the bulk of the details and decisions that lead to the figures, tables and narrative presented in the article. 

The aim of practising reproducible research is to expose more of the research workflow to our audience. This makes it easier for them to make a more informed assessment of our methods and results, and makes it easier for them to adapt our methods to their own research. 

# Taxonomies of reproducibility

Enabling reproducibility can be complicated, but by separating out some of the levels and degrees of reproducibility the problem can become more manageable because we can focus our efforts on what best suits our specific scientific domain. Victoria Stodden (2014), a prominent scholar on this topic, has identified some useful distinctions in reproducible research:

- Computational reproducibility: when detailed information is provided about code, data, software, hardware and implementation details.

- Empirical reproducibility: when detailed information is provided about non-computational empirical scientific experiments and observations

- Statistical reproducibility: when detailed information is provided about the choice of statistical tests, model parameters, threshold values, etc. 

Computational reproducibility has attracted a lot of recent attention from a wide variety of disciplines, and we focus on that here. The other two types of reproducibility are more domain specific and it is more challenging to offer general principles and tools that will be equally useful to everyone.
