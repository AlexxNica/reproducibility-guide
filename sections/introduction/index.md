# Introduction 

Reproducibility is an increasingly important topic in discussions of doing good science. As science becomes more complex, particularly due to the increased role of computational methods, it is less likely that the descriptions contained in scholarly publications are sufficient for others to obtain substantially similar results on their own or extend the published method to new data or new applications. Here, we discuss some of the principles, definitions and complexities of reproducible research and outline some basic steps for promoting reproducibility. While our specific tool and workflow suggestions focus on the computational environment of the R programming language, the principles and definitions sketched out here are applicable to researchers working in any environment.
