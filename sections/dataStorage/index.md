There are many options for data storing depending on duration, data type, and step in data processing.  Simplifying  work flows by having data deposition in central accessible locations helps maintain continuity in analysis and communication. Although there are many options for data storage at the moment, the discussion of the future our scientific data is still evolving and very much in debate.  Scientists should be conscious of how and where our data will be housed at every stage of our research. 

###Data Storage Options 

- [knb](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#data/page/0) Focuses on large ecological datasets, specific to [Ecological Meta Data Languagee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_Metadata_Language) XML data formats. 
- [dataONE](http://www.dataone.org/) Focus on environmental science, community run.
- [Data Dyrad](http://datadryad.org/) Dyrad is free to educators, researchers, and students. They do encourage everyone else to donate to their share of the costs.  

- [figshare](http://figshare.com/?gclid=CIzqiIXiu70CFeJF7AodQU8A_w) A digital repository for scientific products such as data, figures, images, movies, and other content that accompanies how research is communicated.
