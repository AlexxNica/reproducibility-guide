The modularity of workflows allows unprecedented flexibility and customization.  The whole goal is to effortlessly update any aspect of your research without it affecting and making any other aspect obsolete and dated.  For instance, let's say you have new replication data for an experiment that has drastically changed your results and  meeting with collaborators in 10 minutes!  With a fine tuned workflow, you can just add the data to the front end of your workflow and instantaneously it is analyzed and visualized, with a resulting updated manuscript and slide presentation.
